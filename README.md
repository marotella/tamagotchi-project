# tamagotchi-project

# Description
This mini project is themed around "The Sims." The goal is to keep the pet alive to it's elder years by making sure it has fun, eats well, and gets rest. This project was my first project in my coding career and one I view fondly and as a great reminder of the progress I have made since.

# Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Flexbox

# User Stories:
- A user can play the game by naming their sim.
- They select one of two options for hunger, boredom, and sleepiness.
- They can win the game by allowing the Sim to survive to old age.
- They can lose the game if the Sim passes from exhaustion, hunger, or boredom.

# Approach:
This project initially started with the idea of using a more modern version of a "tamagotchi" by using a "Sim." I originally approached the project with only one function for hunger, boredom, and sleep. This led to a dull game experience. I wanted to create a more engaging experience for the user while playing and added an additional function for each aspect of the "Sim" which would have a larger pay off in one area but also decrement another.

# Next Steps:
I would like to enhance the game leveraging more CSS features to display directions on hover and leverage icons to reduce text. I would also like to add an option to select a character.
